# MovieRecommenderSystem
Grad School
This project aims to develop a content-based movie recommender system that incorporates movie title, overview, keywords, genre, cast, runtime, crew, and popularity, as well as voter counts and ratings. The system will showcase several techniques such as tokenization, removing punctuation, stop words, and lemmatization for text preprocessing, CountVectorizer for vectorization, and Cosine similarity for similarity measuring. Some additional implementations like handling incomplete or misspelled inputs and comparing the results between different vectorization technique and similarity measuring technique.
